# Tense-Lite


Tense Lite is a time tracking web application. It is modeled after Jahnel Group's time tracking system Tense. It includes two types of users: Administrators and Basic. The functionality of the program is controlled depending on user types. Admin's may  make new projects, assign users to projects, etc. Users may submit time tracking entries into the project

This was written in Angular for the front end, and Java Spring Boot  in the backend (used Kotlin). I am currently working to deploy the website on AWS.
